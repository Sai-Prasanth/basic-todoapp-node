Maintaining to do task via cli, and it is not required to install node(if need can clone the folder and execute) to run this we can clone this or download the .exe for windows or respective OS present in th folder and can excute commands like -
1. todo-cli.exe add "Complete task" -> to add task
2. todo-cli.exe list -> to list tasks
